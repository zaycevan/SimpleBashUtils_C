Explanation

Starting from the main() function, firstly we are declaring a variable of type regex_t to create the regex, 
then we are declaring an int variable as well to store the outcome of the regex creation process, that whether it was successful or not.
After that we are calling the regcomp() function with the expression as [:word:], 
upon execution, the given expression will be compiled and will get stored at the memory location pointed by the variable rx.
Then after we are checking for the return value of the function regcomp(), if the value comes to be 0, then the compilation process 
of the given expression was successful, if so we are printing the success message, else printing the error message.
Note - The library regex.h comes preinstalled as a part of the libc development package in Linux and macOS, however, 
in the case of windows, Microsoft does not provide regex routines by default, the possible solutions are,

Manual download of the regex library in the system to work with C language, or
Move to C++, and use the c++ regular expression routines as they are part of the C++ Standard from C++11 onwards.
